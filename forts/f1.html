  	<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 30px;">SHANIWAR WADA </h1>
  	<p><img src="../images/s.jpg" style="width:450px;height:500px;margin-right:15px;">Under the Peshwai (leadership) of Bajirao I, the capital of the Maratha Empire shifted from Satara to Pune. Bajirao chose Pune for his seat because he found the climate and geography of Pune most suitable for the Peshwai. As both ceremonies – laying the foundation stone and a house warming – took place on Saturdays and the Wada was built in Shaniwar Peth, it was named Shaniwar Wada</p>

  	<p>The main entrance of the Shaniwar Wada is called the Delhi Darwaza, so called because it faces the north and due to Bajirao’s ambitions of conquering Delhi. The building of Shaniwar Wada is thus a pivotal moment in the history of Pune, which has been the cultural capital of Maharashtra ever since.<br><br>

    Nanasaheb or Balali Bajirao, the son of Bajirao-I, was the longest ruling Peshwa at 41 years and saw the glory of Shaniwar Wada multiplied during his tenure. However, by the end of his rule, the Peshwas had lost the third War of Panipat which resulted in the glory of the Shaniwar Wada being somewhat diminished.<br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    Madhavrao I – Nanasaheb’s second son, his eldest son having been killed in Panipat – who became Peshwa after Nanasaheb, spent considerable time and resources fighting many enemies of the Peshwai, including his uncle Raghobadada), and was thus unable to undertake further constructions in the Wada.<br><br>

	Nanasaheb’s third son Narayanrao was appointed Peshwa after the death of Madhavrao. Raghobadada, who was the regent for Narayanrao, soon had major disagreements with his nephew, leading to Raghobadada being placed under house arrest. During the Ganesh Festival of 1773, several armed Gardi soldiers led by Sumer Singh Gardi entered the Shaniwar Wada, either with the intent of freeing Raghobadada and his wife or attacking Narayanrao. During the skirmish in the Wada, the young Peshwa was cut down by the Gardis. The body of Narayanrao is believed to be smuggled out of the Wada through the Jambhul Darwaza (the gate used previously by concubines) and cremated by the river at midnight.</p>

			According to popular legend, Raghobadada had written to the Gardis with the Marathi word ‘धरा’ (to hold Narayanrao) but the letter was intercepted by his wife Anandibai (Raghobadada’s senior wife), who changed a single letter in the word, making it ‘मारा’ (kill). Narayanrao, after being chased by the Gardis, is said to have run inside the Wada crying ‘काका मला वाचावा’ (uncle, save me). This gruesome crime is said to have brought ill fate to the Peshwai, which never rose to its previous heights after Narayanrao’s demise. Rumour has it that Narayanrao’s cries for help are still heard around the Shaniwar Wada making it one of the most famously haunted places in India.<br><br>

			Sawai Madhavrao, the next Peshwa and the son of Narayanrao is said to have been both physically and mentally weak. At the age of 21, he is believed to have jumped into the Hazari fountain, which was built for the pleasure of the infant Sawai Madhavrao, and died after sustaining severe injuries. Thus this majestic Wada witnessed not only the gory murder of a Peshwa but also the unfortunate suicide of his son, forever damaging the psyche of the Peshwai.<br><br>

      Next to become Peshwa was Bajirao II, son of Raghobadada, who proved to be the antithesis of his namesake – Bajirao I. Bajirao II is said to have been incompetent and cowardly and his tenure saw the Maratha confederacy being surrendered to the British by 1817, making him the last Peshwa. The union jack was hoisted in Shaniwar Wada on the 17th November 1917, marking the consolidation of colonial rule in India.<br><br>
