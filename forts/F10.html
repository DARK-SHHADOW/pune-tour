    <h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 30px;">TUNG FORT</h1>
    <p><img src="../images/tf5.jpg" style="width:450px;height:500px;margin-right:15px;">Tung Fort (Marathi: <m>तुंग</m> किल्ला/कठिणगड)(or Kathingad; difficult fort in Marathi) is a hill fort in Pune District, India.</p>

    <p><h1>Location</h1>
It is about 12 km from Malavli railway station and can also be approached from Lonavala. Tung Fort has an elevation of 1075 m above sea level.Since Pawna was built, it is now surrounded by water on three sides. One can ferry across in a boat from Pawna dam to its base village, Tungi.<br><br>

<h1>History</h1>
Little is known about the origins of this fort. There is a vihara on the fort datable to circa seventh-eight centuries A.D. Malik Ahmad Nizam Shah I of the Nizam Shahi dynasty conquered the fort in 1585 and annexed it to the Nizam territory. In 1657, Shivaji Maharaj brought the whole of Konkan, which had been Nizam territory, under his control when he conquered Tikona along with the forts of Karnala, Lohgad, Mahuli, Songad, Tala, and Visapur.This fort was a strategic nexus: the centre of control for the entire Pawana Mawal region. In 1660, Dhamale family, the Deshmukhs from Maval region were charged with ensuring the security of fort Tikona.It was under the Dhamale Deshmukh family for long time. Jaysingh invaded the region in 1665 and attacked the local villages but the forts held out. <br><br>Tikona fort was surrendered to the Mughal warrior Kubadkhan, who had attacked the region together with Halal Khan and others, according to the Treaty of Purandar signed on 12 June 1665. Kubad Khan took over the fort on 18 June but it was later recaptured by the Marathas.In 1682 King Sambhaji met Aurangzeb's son Akbar. After the meeting the Akbar was offered to stay on Tikona fort, however he was shifted to Jaitapur as the climate didn't suit him. A small battle was fought by Maratha army with British in 1818, before it was captured by the latter.<br><br></p>

  <h1>How to reach</h1>
The nearest town is Kamshet which is 51;km from Pune. The base village of the fort is Tikona peth which is 26 km from Kamshet. There are good hotels at Kamshet, now tea and snacks are also available in small hotels at Tikonapeth and Kale colony. The trekking path starts from the hillock south of the parking area near Tikonapeth. The route is very safe and wide. There are few trees on the trekking route. It takes about an hour to reach the entrance gate of the fort. There are very steep and high, which makes the climb a thrilling experience. There is very less space on the fort. It is advisable not to accompany large groups for climbing the fort.<br><br> The steps are so narrow that only a single person can climb at a time. The night stay on the fort can be made in the caves either near the entrance of the fort or on the top of the fort. The villagers from the local fort restoration committee in the Tikonapeth make night stay and food arrangements at a reasonable cost. The Bedse caves which are on the way from Kamshet can also be visited on the way to Tikona on the same day.<br><br>
