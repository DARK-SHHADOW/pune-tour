    <h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 30px;">MATHERAN</h1>
    <p><img src="../images/m1.jpg" style="width:450px;height:500px;margin-right:15px;">Matheran is situated at a height of 803 m above sea level. Since 1907, a narrow gauge railway line connects Matheran to Neral in the plains. Motor vehicles are completely banned in Matheran, making it quite peaceful despite the thousands of visitors that come here, mostly from Mumbai. There are a number of lookout points that provide spectacular views of the surrounding hills and valley.Matheran is a plateau with a reasonably dense forest cover. Being a hill station it is pleasant almost throughout the year. In winter, the nights can get a bit chilly though..</p>

    <p>The best time to go to Matheran is post-monsoon. It is truly spectacular at this time of the year with lush greenery, waterfalls and the lake full with water. The best times to visit Matheran are between: Sept.to November; Feb. to March. (Dec & Jan are pretty chilly here). However, people from Mumbai (Churchgate to Dahanu & C.S.M.T. (V.T.) to Karjat, Kasara) are seen visiting every week end mostly with their family as a part of their outing and relaxation. It is also a good place for Sadhana (Meditations), retreats and yogas.<br><br>

    
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <h1>Get in</h1>
There is a entry fee (of Rs 50 for adult visitors and Rs.25 for children from June 1, 2015)to Matheran. The proceeds from this is used for the upkeep of the place considering its fragile ecosystem.<br><br>
<h1>By train</h1>
You can get either by-<br>

a Karjat bound local train<br>
the 07.10 Deccan Express (arrives at 08.38 in time for the 08.50)<br>
from CST (a.k.a. VT Mumbai, India) on the Central Railway to Neral Station.<br><br></p>

</div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  If coming from Pune, catch any Mumbai bound train and get off at Karjat (Around 95 kms from Pune).Then catch a CST bound local train from Karjat and get down at Neral (21 kms, would take around 15 min).<br><br>

From Neral Station , there is a toy train which runs to Matheran about 4 times in a day. This toy train is not operational when railway route is under maintenance or when there is a perceived hazard e.g. the monsoons. Unfortunately, the only way to find this out is at the Neral Station.<br><br>

Neral to Matheran tickets as of February 2015 costs are Full deluxe salon (6 people) 1500 Rs., 1st Class 300Rs p.p., 2nd Class Reserved 75Rs p.p., Ordinary 60Rs p.p. Tickets can be booked at Neral station from 3 to 1 day in advance, and then on the day of travel from 45 minutes before the train. You cannot reserve the tickets online through IRCTC.<br><br>

The train is often full, so turn up in good time to ensure you get a ticket - tickets usually sell out 1 hour in advance of the journey time and waiting time in queue can be as long as 30 - 60 minutes. If there's a queue of unmoving people at the ticket window with a salesman who's reading the paper, then all the 2nd class tickets are sold out. Jump the queue to the window and ask for 1st class as the're usually available     <br><br>

The toy train can feel slow and rather painfully slow in summers when sun is at its peak. In such a situation, it is a better choice to opt for shared cabs that take you to Matheran from Neral railway station in 20 minutes as opposed to a 2.5 hour ride in the train. The distance from Neral to Dasturi Point(last point to which vehicles are allowed in Matheran)is 11 km. The drivers that ply through the roads have immaculate driving skills, so a real advice here is not to keep eyeing the blind turns and foot-to-brake co-ordination, but to just enjoy the breath-taking views as you climb up towards the Dasturi point. (Charges are INR 70.00 per person ($1.2) as of Oct'12. Also make sure you take the rearmost seats as it will provide a relatively more comfortable travel) Once you have left the taxi, you can take a horse ride or get the help of porters to carry luggage up to the town.<br><br>

There is sadly no convenient express train to get back to CST in the evening. You can get a local train from Neral to Karjat (away from Mumbai), and then an express train back from Karjat into Mumbai. But this will take longer than just getting a local train from Neral back into town.<br><br>

 <div style="color: #f2190a"><h1>PLACES/POINTS TO VISIT IN MATHERAN</h1>
