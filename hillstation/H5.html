    <h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 30px;">PAACHGANI</h1>
    <p><img src="../images/ppg1.jpg" style="width:450px;height:500px;margin-right:15px;">Paachgani, also called Panchgani, is a hill station and municipal council in Satara district in Maharashtra, India. Paachgani attracts many tourists throughout the year. It is also renowned for many premier residential educational institutions.</p>

    <p>Paachgani is around 102 kilometres from Pune and 250 kilometres from Mumbai.<br><br>

    <h1>History</h1>
Paachgani was developed by the British during the British Raj as a summer resort under the supervision of Lord John Chesson in the 1860s. Paachgani was developed as a retirement place because it remained pleasant throughout the year. He surveyed the hills of this region with Rustomji Dubash, and finally decided on this nameless area around the five villages: Dandeghar, Godavali, Ambral, Khingar, and Taighat. The place was aptly named Paachgani, meaning "land between five villages", and Chesson was made superintendent.<br><br>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

To develop the infrastructure, Chesson encouraged various professionals - tailors, dhobis, butchers, vegetable vendors, building contractors - to also settle in Paachgani . The area below the bazaar was allotted to them, and is now known as the gaothan. He is credited with planting plant species from the western world in Paachgani , including silver oak and poinsettia, which have flourished since then in Paachgani . Chesson is buried in the graveyard of St. Peter's Church. In 1971 or '72, his death centenary was observed in a big way when for the first time, the town folk and the schools participated together in a ceremony to remember the founder of Paachgani .<br><br></p>

  <br><h1>Boarding schools</h1>
A number of schools were started in the 19th century across different communities, and Paachgani started flourishing as an educational town.<br><br>

In the 1890s, Kimmins High School was started for European boys and girls. 1902, the boys' section separated to become European Boys High School, now known as St. Peter's School, Panchgani, and Kimmins became an exclusive girls school. In 1895, the Roman Catholic order of nuns known as "Daughters of The Cross" started St. Joseph's Convent School, Paachgani . All three boarding schools were modeled on the English Public Schools of that time, and were affiliated to Cambridge University. The board exams would be held in December, the question papers being sent from England by sea. The answer papers sent back by sea, and the results declared in June.<br><br>

Shortly afterward, other communities started their schools. These schools were affiliated to matriculation examination of the Bombay Presidency. The Parsi School, the first of these schools, later became the Billimoria School. The Muslim School became the Union High School, and is now known as Anjuman-I-Islam School. Both these schools were modelled on the English Public Schools. <br><br>Hindu High School was started, now known as the Sanjeewan Vidyalaya. This was modelled on Rabindranath Tagore's Shantiniketan. The Baháʼí Faith community started a Baháʼí school, open to students of all religions, and was renamed the New Era High School. A retired teacher from the Parsi High School, Mr. S. M. Batha started the S. M. Batha High School.<br><br>

<h1>Convalescence center</h1>
The fresh air and invigorating climate of Paachgani made it a good place for convalescence. A well-known tuberculosis specialist from Bombay, Dr. Rustomji Bomanji Billimoria set up the Bel Air sanatorium, in the 1940s, as a centre for the treatment of TB. Till the advent of antibiotics, Dalkieth was the premier place for the treatment of tuberculosis in the Bombay Presidency.<br><br>

<h1>Geography</h1>
Paachgani is nestled in the middle of five hills in the Sahyādri mountain ranges. There are five villages around Paachgani named Dandeghar, Khingar, Godavali, Ambral & Taighat. The Krishnā River flows in the valley on which the Dhom Dam has been built approximately 9 km from Wai. The east of the Panchgani is Wai, Bavdhan & Nagewadi dam, at west is Gureghar, at the south is Khingar & Rajpuri & on the north is Dhom Dam.<br><br>

The five hills surrounding Paachgani are topped by a volcanic plateau, which is the second highest in Asia after the Tibet Plateau. These plateaus, alternatively known as "table land", are a part of the Deccan Plateau, they were raised by pressure between the earth plates. The area has high seismic activity, with an epicenter near Koynānagar where the Koynanagar Dam and a hydroelectric power plant have been built.<br><br>

<h1>Environmental issues</h1>
In recent times, Paachgani has been facing ecological problems because of poorly controlled commercial activities, excessive traffic, and temperature inversion (because of humidity) from the new dams which have been built in the vicinity for water storage.<br><br>

<h1>Climate</h1>
The temperature in Paachgani is around 12 degrees Celsius during winter, and sometimes reaches 34 degrees Celsius during summer; humidity level is very low except in the Monsoon. Monsoon rainy season spans between June and September.<br><br>
