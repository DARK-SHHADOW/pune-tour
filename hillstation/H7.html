    <p><img src="../images/la1.jpg" style="width:450px;height:500px;margin-right:15px;">Lavasa (Marathi: लवासा, lavāsā) is a private, planned city built near Pune. It is stylistically based on the Italian town Portofino, with a street and several buildings bearing the name of that town.<br><br>
A 25,000 acres (100 km2)or 8,000 acres (32 km2) project being developed by HCC, this as-yet-incomplete city has been controversial for multiple reasons including procurement of land,harm to the environment, and loans acquired through political corruption.</p>

    <p>In late 2010, the Indian Environment and Forests Ministry ordered that construction cease because the project violated environmental laws.As of late 2011, this order has been rescinded. The project's scale may have been reduced, however, and an initial public offering may not occur. The head of the company working on the project said in 2013 that due to the Environment and Forests Ministry, the project had "lost three years".<br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
   </m>History</m><br><br>
Fortune Hotel, Lavasa Billed as India's first hill station since independence, this private city is being constructed by a unit of Ajit Gulabchand. The architectural team responsible for the design of the town wants it be an imitation of an Italian hill-side town<br><br>
<m>Land</m><br><br>
The area demarcated for Lavasa is located near Pune in the Mulshi valley of the Western Ghats.<br><br>
Current progress<br><br>
Construction of two out of the five planned towns is ongoing, and a number of residences have been completed as of 2013. By 2011 four hotels and a city centre were completed.A primary, middle, and high school, Le Mont High, has been constructed as well. The town also boasts a hospitality management college, École hôtelière Lavasa.</p>

  <br><m>Administration</m><br><br>
Scot Wrighton is the administrator of the city as of 2011.<br>
Surrounding villages<br>
Smaller, pre-existing communities sometimes interact with Lavasa and its residents. Some have been the focus of CSR efforts,and villagers provide construction labour to the project.
<m>Future plans</m><br><br>
Lavasa has established a pattern of promoting planned partnerships with prestigious, overseas institutions that do not ultimately see fruition. Oxford University had at one point associateditself with the project, but other, name-brand plans including future sports facilities have yet to be officially canceled.<br><br>
The city has a better track record when it comes to construction; some sections are complete today. It is thought that Lavasa will not be finished before 2020, however. When fully built, its total population may be 200,000, and it will comprise of four or five towns built on seven hills. The first of these, Dasve, was initially slated to be complete by 2010 although some residences there were still under construction as of 2013. Mugaon, the second town, may be finished in 2013,and as of May, 2013, construction continues. Work on this town began in mid-2012. In 2013, the chairman of the construction company building the project confirmed that Lavasa will include four large towns and one low-cost town.<br><br>
<m>Sports facilities</m><br><br>
Planned sports facilities include a Nick Faldo-designed golf course and a Manchester City-branded football academy.<br><br>
However, the Nick Faldo website no longer touts the golf course, and a 2010 press release isthe sole communication Manchester City has made in reference to a football academy.<br><br>
Theme park<br><br>
A theme park of over 65 acres (0.26 km2) in size is planned.<br><br>
<m>Architecture at Lavasa</m><br><br>
Lavasa has won several awards for its plans and designs. In 2005, Dasve village in Lavasa won awards from the Congress for the New Urbanism and the American Society of Landscape Architects. In 2009, the St. Louis chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects recognised the Lavasa landscape master plan with a merit award.s<br><br>
