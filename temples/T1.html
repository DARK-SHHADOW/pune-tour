    <p><img src="../images/D2.jpg" style="width:450px;height:500px;margin-right:15px;">A famous Ganesha temple in Pune is Shreemath Dagdusheth Halwai Temple which is a major attraction in Maharashtra. The temple is visited by thousands of pilgrims every year. The annual ten-day celebrations named Ganeshotsav is the main festival conducted at the temple when celebrities and ministers arrive to pay tribute to the Lord. The main idol is insured for a sum of Rs.10 million and it is one of the very famous places in Pune and one of the amazing places to visit in Pune with family.</p>

    <p>Dagadusheth Halwai was the founder of the temple who was a trader, businessman and a sweet maker. He was from Karnataka and settled in Pune long ago. But his son died due to an epidemic and afterwards he and his wife fell into steep depression and to heal themselves, they were advised to build a Ganesh temple by their Guru Shri Madhavnath Maharaj.
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The construction of the temple was finished in1893. The great leader Lokmanya Tilak was a contemporary of Dagdusheth and a close friend of him. He had the idea of celebrating Ganesh festival at the temple and then onwards, it became an epoch-making event. The beautiful temple has Jay and Vijay, the two sentinels made of marble attracts the millions of hearts coming to visit the temple. The temple was constructed very simply so that the idol of Ganesha can be seen from outside. The idol is huge with 7.5 feet height and 4 feet width. It was made more beautiful by adding nearly 8 kilogrammes of gold. Devotees of the temple offered money and gold regularly and heaps of coconuts are also a special offer done by the people.

The deity of Lord Ganesha was incepted by Shri Dagdusheth Halwai and his wife Lakshmibai way back, when they lost their only son to the plague epidemic. Every year, the Ganpati festival was celebrated with deep faith and enthusiasm, not only by Dagdusheth’s family but the entire neighbourhood. Tatyasaheb Godse, then in his early youth, was a zestful participant in the celebrations. In later years, when Lokmanya Tilak made Ganpati festival a public celebration to bring people together for the freedom struggle, Dagdusheth Ganpati became the most respected and popular idol in Pune.

<br><br>In 1952, the responsibility of organizing the festival at Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati temple officially fell upon Tatyasaheb and his group of friends. Under Tatyasaheb’s able guidance and leadership, his associates like Mamasaheb Rasane, Adv. Shankarrao Suryavanshi and K. D. Rasane planned and executed the festival with meticulous planning and professionalism, and since then, there was no looking back for them. As generous donors and devotees contributed towards the temple fund, Tatyasaheb and his friends thought what better way to worship the Lord than to serve our own fellow beings.

Soon, the young motivated group took the activities of the festival and the temple beyond traditional worship, into the domain of social and cultural development. <br><br>Besides a rich religious schedule at the temple, they engaged in addressing the social and political problems of the state.

Under the aegis of Dagdusheth Halwai Sarvajanik Ganpati Trust, they started several social initiatives including educational and financial support to deprived children, micro finance to small businessmen and vendors through Suvarnayug Sahakari Bank, old age home, rehabilitation of workers working at brick kilns to name only a few.

Today, by Lord Ganesha’s blessings, Dagdusheth Halwai Sarvajanik Ganpati Trust has flourished into a veteran organization that is gratified to worship the Lord through its service to humanity.<br><br>
